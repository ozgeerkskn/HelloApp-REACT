# HelloApp-REACT
This simple React app includes an input field where the user enters their name and then creates a title text using that name. When the user clicks the "Submit" button after entering their name, the title text is updated to "Hello [name]". Additionally, when the mouse hovers over and leaves the button, the background color of the button changes.
